# A generative nonparametric Bayesian model for whole genomes

This repository contains the code to recreate experiments from our paper "A generative nonparametric Bayesian model for
whole genomes" and to deploy the BEAR model on sequence data.

## Overview

Bayesian embedded autoregresive (BEAR) models are generative probabilistic
models for biological sequences that work at the genome scale.
This package provides example BEAR models and tools for implementing new ones.

## Usage

For instructions on running examples and deploying the BEAR model, consult the documentation in the file documentation.pdf.
