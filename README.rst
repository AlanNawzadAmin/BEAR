BEAR
****
This repository contains the code to recreate experiments from our preprint (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.446360v1) and to deploy the BEAR model on sequence data.

========
Overview
========
Bayesian embedded autoregresive (BEAR) models are generative probabilistic
models for biological sequences that work at the genome scale.
This package provides example BEAR models and tools for implementing new ones.

=====
Usage
=====
For instructions on running examples and deploying the BEAR model, consult the documentation at https://bear-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
