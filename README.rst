BEAR
****
This repository contains the code to recreate experiments from our preprint (COMING SOON) and to deploy the BEAR model on sequence data.

========
Overview
========
Bayesian embedded autoregresive (BEAR) models are generative probabilistic
models for biological sequences that work at the genome scale.
This package provides example BEAR models and tools for implementing new ones.

Usage
